# Maze-Race
A fun and interactive visualization where A*, Dijkstra's, BFS, and DFS algorithms race through a maze to reach the goal. The maze resets each time, allowing you to observe how each algorithm handles the same challenge differently. Perfect for learning and comparing pathfinding techniques in action!
