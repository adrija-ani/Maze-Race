#  Algorithm Maze Race 🏁  

A fun and educational visualization where classic pathfinding algorithms — A*, Dijkstra’s, BFS and DFS — race through a randomly generated maze to reach a target block.

---

##  Overview

This project puts the theory of pathfinding algorithms into motion by letting them compete in real time. The maze resets for each race, giving you a clear visual of how each algorithm approaches the same problem.

Whether you're a student, developer, or algorithm enthusiast, this project helps you understand:

- How each algorithm explores the maze  
- Trade-offs between speed, optimality, and memory usage  
- Why theoretical differences really matter in practice

##  Algorithms Implemented

- *A\** (A Star) – Fast and optimal with heuristics  
- *Dijkstra’s Algorithm* – Guaranteed shortest path but slower  
- *Breadth-First Search (BFS)* – Explores level by level  
- *Depth-First Search (DFS)* – Goes deep quickly, not always optimal
